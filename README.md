# Bridge Opening Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the opening times of the [Södertälje Mälarbro](https://www.sjofartsverket.se/sv/tjanster/kanaler-slussar-broar/sodertalje---malarbron/) using the Automatic Identification System (AIS) 
data from vessels in the surrounding area. By analyzing patterns and correlations in AIS data, the machine learning 
model seeks to provide accurate predictions of bridge opening events, aiding in traffic management and planning for 
both maritime and road traffic.

## Data Collection
The model relies on AIS data, which includes various information about the vessels such as their location, speed, 
direction, and identification details. The `scrape.py` script is used for collecting this data from designated sources.

## Model Description
The machine learning model will process the AIS data to identify patterns or conditions under which the bridge is 
likely to open. This may involve analyzing factors such as vessel size, type, speed, and proximity to the bridge.

## Usage
Details on how to run the `scrape.py` script and the machine learning model will be included here. 
This will cover the setup, necessary dependencies, and step-by-step instructions for executing the model.
